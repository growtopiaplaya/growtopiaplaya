This program is open source and it does not contain any harmful objects, if you do not believe me, open the files in a text editor :). I am a new programmer and the code might be a bit messy, but it definitely works!


After download, unzip the files. I recommend you place them in a folder. Then, double click Maker.py. That creats a .ini file named "values" in the folder. All values will be set to 0 and changed when you set up the program.

Now run bfg.py, then type which way you want to break in. right or left?

The answer should be either the letter "l" for left or "r" for right. If not one of those letters is entered, program will crash.

When you get to where it will ask you for the x and y values, open up getValues.py, right click on the requirements positions, for example, when it asks you to right click on the first block, go in growtopia and right click there

That will get you 2 numbers per right click, the first one is x and the 2nd one is y.

After you have entered all the x and y values, the program will ask you how long it takes to break the blocks. There you should write a number, not a decimal number, a whole number (for example "1" or "2").

For each number you enter, the program will hold punch for 0.35 seconds. For me, I am able to break lgrids with a pickaxe by entering the number "2", pepper with the same value, and chands with "3".

You should have your game in the background, because after you have entered the number, the program will automatically start changing ur mouse position, and if set-up properly, it should now autofarm.
